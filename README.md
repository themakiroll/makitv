Multimedia Bulletin Board system built for libraries.

MakiTV augments digital signage for library applications by integrating audiovisual and live Web content in a dynamic display, with additional features for libraries such as a featured books gallery and visual paging. The system is based on a project I originally developed in 2011 for my undergraduate research.

The source code will be uploaded as soon as I finish the first version. :)
